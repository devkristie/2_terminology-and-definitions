            <dt>1. Name the three ways to declare a variable?</dt>            
            <dd>var wordHere = "answer";</dd>
            <dd>let wordHere = "answer";</dd>

        </dl>

        <dl>
            <dt>2. Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?</dt>            
            <dd>var, because it is the old way of declaring a variable. It is prefered now to use the newer ways. It is a global scope.</dd>
        </dl>
        <br>
        <dl>
            <dt>3. What rules should you follow when naming variables?</dt>            
            <dd>The name should only contain letters, digits or the symbols $ and _</dd>
            <dd>The first character should not be a digit.</dd>
            <dd>When using multiple words it should be written in camelCase or using one _</dd>
            <dd>The name should be a clear name of what the variable is representing and have a clean, obvious meaning describing the data that it stores.</dd>
            <dd>Agree on terms within your team and in your mind, for example if the team uses wordUser make sure you use anotherWordUser in variables.</dd>

        <dl>
            <dt>4. What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and strings?</dt>
            <dd>Using + operator with numbers uses additional mathematics which add them together.</dd>          
            <dd>If + is applied to strings it concatenates them.</dd>
            <dd>If there is a number being added to a string it converts the number into a string.</dd>

        <dl>
            <dt>5. How does the % operator work?</dt>
            <dd>% is the Modulus (Division Remainder).</dd>
            <dd>The remainder operator returns the remainder left over when one operand is divided by a second operand.</dd>
            <dd>let num1 = 10; <br>
                let num2 = 3; <br>

            <dd>NaN represents a computational error.</dd>
            <dd>It is a result of an incorrect or undefined mathematical operation.</dd>
            <!--<dd>Anything that can not be interpreted as a number by removing the quotes will evaluate as NaN.</dd>-->

        <dl>
            <dt>9. Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement operators.</dt>            
            <dd>If you use the ++ operator as a prefix like: ++var, the value of var is incremented by 1; then it returns the value.</dd>
            <dd>If you use the ++ operator as a postfix like: var++, the original value of var is returned first; then var is incremented by 1.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
            <dt>10. What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?</dt>            
            <dd>The precedence of an operator specifies how "tightly" it binds two expressions together. For example, in the expression 1 + 5 * 3, the answer is 16 and not 18 because the multiplication ("*") operator has a higher precedence than the addition ("+") operator. Parentheses may be used to force precedence, if necessary. For instance: (1 + 5) * 3 evaluates to 18.</dd>

            <dt>13. What are the eight data types in JavaScript?</dt>            
            <dd><strong>String</strong></dd>
            <dd>String Data type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values.</dd>
            <dd><strong>Number</strong></dd>
            <dd>Number Data type is for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±253.</dd>
            <dd><strong>Boolean</strong></dd>
            <dd>Boolean is a primitive data type in javascript. Boolean data types consist of logical They consist of two possible values “true” or “false”.</dd>
            <dd><strong>BigInt</strong></dd>
            <dd>BigInt data type is for integer numbers of arbitrary length. With BigInt, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for numbers.</dd>
            <dd><strong>Null</strong></dd>
            <dd>The null data type represents the value 0 it means this data type did not consist any data.</dd>
            <dd><strong>Undefined</strong></dd>
            <dd>A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined.</dd>
            <dd><strong>Symbol</strong></dd>
            <dd>The symbol data type is used for giving unique identifiers.</dd>
            <dd><strong>Object</strong></dd>
            <dd>In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties. With the object literal syntax, a limited set of properties are initialized; then properties can be added and removed. Property values can be values of any type, including other objects, which enables building complex data structures. Properties are identified using key values. A key value is either a String or a Symbol value.</dd>

            <dd>Null is an object, whereas undefined is a type. Therefore, the null and undefined are falsy values.</dd>
            <dd>Null is a value representing nothing, empty or value unknown. It makes a type of its own.</dd>
            <dd>Undefined is a value that is not defined. It makes a type of its own, just like Null.</dd>

            <dd><strong>|| (OR)</strong></dd>
            <dd>The “OR” operator is represented with two vertical line symbols: <br>

                finds the first truthy value</dd>
            <dd><strong>&& (AND)</strong></dd>
            <dd>The AND operator is represented with two ampersands &&: <br>

                finds the first falsy value</dd>
            <dd><strong>! (NOT)</strong></dd>
            <dd>The boolean NOT operator is represented with an exclamation sign !. <br>
                result = !value; <br>
                The precedence of NOT ! is the highest of all logical operators, so it always executes first, before && or ||.</dd>

            <dt>26. What are conditionals?</dt>            
            <dd>Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run.<br>
                There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including:<br>
                “If” statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.<br>
                “Else” statements: where if the same condition is false it specifies the execution for a block of code.<br>
                “Else if” statements: this specifies a new test if the first condition is false.</dd>
                <dd>Listed below are some of the conditional statements frequently used in javascript.<br>

            <dt>35. What are return values?</dt>            
            <dd>JavaScript passes a value from a function back to the code that called it by using the return statement. The value to be returned is specified in the return. That value can be a constant value, a variable, or a calculation where the result of the calculation is returned.</dd>

                let sum = (a, b) => a + b; <br>
                This is a shorter form of: <br>
                let sum = function(a, b) { <br>
                    return a + b; <br>
                }; <br>
                alert( sum(1, 2) );<br>
