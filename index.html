                    <dt>What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?</dt>            
                        <dd><strong>External stylesheet</strong> is a standalone .css file linked from a web page. Using external stylesheets, you can apply rules to multiple web pages. If you ever need to make widespread changes to your website design, a single change in the stylesheet can be applied to all linked pages, saving lots of time and effort.</dd>
                        <dd><strong>Internal stylesheet</strong> holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, but you can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</dd>
                        <dd><strong>Inline styles</strong> relate to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element. They're useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal stylesheets, as each inline style you create must be edited separately if you're making a design change.</dd>

                        <dd>The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element. Decendant combinators are represented by a single space between selectors.</dd>

                        <dd>The border is drawn between the margin and the padding of a box. If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the width and height of the box. If you are using the alternative box model then the size of the border makes the content box smaller.</dd>

                        <dd><strong>Block elements</strong> consume the entire width available irrespective of their sufficiency. They always start in a new line and have top and bottom margins. It does not contain any other elements next to it.</dd>
                        <dd><strong>Inline elements</strong> occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline. Inline elements don't start from a new line and don't have top and bottom margins as block elements have.</dd>

                        <dd>Elements with inline-block are like inline elements, but they can have a width and a height. That means that you can use an inline-block element as a block while flowing it within text or other elements.</dd>
